You will find that this process is easier than you can imagine and with a little bit of pratiques you will be able to create your own package. In addition, you will discover that this way open you the field to develop reproducible code, documented faster and simply your processes at many levels and learn how other people can download and use it.\nAll this website and material associated if free to use, licenced under the CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 licence. At least you will find below several training sessions available if you want a guided explanation for R package creation.\nTo conclude, this support was developed according to the book R Packages (2e) [1] written by Hadley Wickham and Jennifer Bryan.

When you develop your package, one of the aims could be to share or propose your work to other peoples and you have to take into account about the variability of the processes among OS, software for example R dependencies. We will put in place several processes to support us in our task but keep in your mind that processes that work on an OS could not work in the same pattern in another one. Futermore, one of our tasks among the lifecycle of our package will be to maintain a maximum of compatibility, for example through integration of update or evolution in our code.\nDeveloping R packages assume that you have a little experience with the R software and not start from scratch with it. Even if you see that R package development is not so hard that it looks like, you will find a lot of resources on the internet to support you if you want to start with R and develop your skills in it.\nUnder Windows OS, it’s necessary to install the RTools software. This is a toolchains for building R and R packages from source on Windows. And don’t need it on macOS and Linux because theses OS have usually pre-installed compilation tools. You can download it from the offical link.Be aware that you need to take the correct version according to our R version installated (for this training it would be the RTools 4.5).",

You will find also precompiled binary distributions for Linux and macOS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, we will use the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) RStudio. Today this software is one of the most used in the R communities and includes a lot of things like a console, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, and tools for plotting, history, debugging, and workspace management. Furthermore, recent evolution like the creation of Posit compagny make the software ecosystem more friendly connected with R and Python. For the training we will use the RStudio version 2025.05.0+496 “Mariposa Orchid” for Windows OS. You can download the one for your configuration throught the Posit download webpage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt least, we will using Git, for version control system, to host our R package and apply several processes of Continuous Integration (CI), most of them already prepare by the R communities. Today, this is a very precious tool that helps developers track changes in their code, collaborate efficiently, and manage different versions of a project. During this training we will use one of them. You can download the software on the offical website throught this link.",

    "text": "1.2 Additional software\nSeveral software are not necessary to create your own R package but bring you a lot of improvement and at leave simplify you life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first one is Visual Studio Code (or VS Code) which is a free, lightweight, extensible code editor developed by Microsoft. He supports a wide variety of programming languages such as R, JavaScript, Python, C++, Java, HTML/CSS. In addition is cross-platform compatibility, support Git and other version control systems and one of his best advantages is to provide extensions to add functionality and customize the environment. If you want you can download it from this offical website and if it’s possible according to your configuration prefer a system installer version. For this training I will use the version 1.100.2 on Windows OS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the use of Git, we will use one of them call GitHub. You will see that a loot of processes were developed for work natively with GitHub and facilitate your R package creation. If you want to use another one, like a GitLab hosted by your company for example, you can of course but you will have to modify and adapted by yourself several processes propose during this training. In addition we will use here a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for managing Git repositories called GitHub Desktop. This is a free, open-source application which simplifies current Git operations, making it easier for developers to clone repositories, commit changes, create branches, and push updates without using the command line. Like its name suggests is working natively with GitHub repositories but you can also use it for connection with other Git like GitLab. Officially is available for Windows and MacOS but you can also find adapted version for Linux on the internet. For download it goes through the following link.",

    "text": "This section aim to introduce brively which R packages environment we will use. Since several years, the R communities evolve in many interesting ways and today if you want to write your own package there are a lot of support that you can find.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst of all, it’s difficult to talk about package whithout talk about the tidyverse approach. Tidyverse is a collection of R packages designed for data science. They share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures. If you use R, it’s allmost sure that you have allready use this kind of packages, maybe even without knowing them. Even if there are none mandatary for R use, theses packages bring a lot of benefices and at the end make data science easier, faster, and more fun (yes, you will see).\n\n\nSo far we don’t go deeper into all the useful R packages of the tidyverse collection, but only focusing on theses related to the R packages developement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first one is called devtools [1]. The aim of this package is to make R package development easier by providing R functions that simplify and expedite common tasks. In practical, if you use the Rstudio IDE you will not interact directly with this package because the majority of common processes will be integrated automatically in the Rstudio environment and become “click button” processes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second one is the sub-package you are most likely to interact with directly. It be called usethis [2] and is aim is to automates repetitive tasks that arise during project setup and development. The idea is to, if it’s possible, use functions available by the package, rather that modify directely the code, to reduce error and be sure to have the last version of process strucutre.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are two more important packages related to design of the documentation: roxygen2 [3] and pkgdown [4]. With the first one throught the use of tags, the code and the documentation are adjacent and dynamically inspects the objects that it’s documenting. We will go back to them into the following sections but keep in your mind that theses two tools simplify and automate the documentation creation and evolution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe last one is called testthat [5] and focusing on the field of testing your code, which can be painful and tedious, but it greatly increases the quality of your code.\n\n\nIn addition we will use or talk about several other packages, for example lintr [6] or renv [7], but it’s more a case-by-case utilisation and we will discuss them when the time comes.\n\n\n\n\n1.

    "text": "Before we start to developing our first R package, let’s talk briefly about the aim to organise your code into a package and in fact why we consume time to develop this kind of structure.\nWhen you use R, a package is the fundamental unit of shareable codes and brings a lot of advantage, like regroup in one place all the stuff (code, data, documentation for example), improve the standardisation of your process and the sharing them easier. In fact, build an R package is nothing more than a way of organising things that you have already done by another way and facilitate at the end the life cycle of your processes.\nFurthermore, you will see quickly that you can use a lot of processes already developed ,and update in time, by the R communauties. There are package that make package, processes that allow to automated tasks and the tidyverse philosophy explain in the previous section help a lot.\nTo summarise:\n\ndon’t worry, you will see that all this process is painless and you will be able to create very great thing in brief time,\nin addition, you will save time! you will follow a template and automate a lot of processes with the rule “anything that can be automated, should be automated”,\nto conclude, you will use standardised conventions that open to you the path a several free and evolving standardised tools.",

The idea is not to spend a very long time to do that, but if you take this time (especially is it’s the first time) you will see that at the end you will gain. The majority of the package component can be modified after definition, but some update could be heavy and painful and sometimes it’s simple to avoid that by taking a moment of reflection.\nThe aim here is to answer the question, what I want to put into my package or what I want my package will do? You don’t have to be exhaustive (if you can it’s better) but try to explore several fields like:\nYou can image other cases and again it’s normal if your perimeter evolve with time regarding the maturity of your work. A good solution could be to design flux diagrams for example explain (even for you) the process and maybe associated one. In addition, these kinds of figures could be useful for the documentation process. A quick research on the internet will be displaying several software, free and paid, for doing that.",

At a time where the referencing (like the SEO or Search Engine Optimisation) and visibility is important items regarding the life of your work, it could be bad to lose points at this moment just because the name is not very clear and friendly.\nGlobably, I advise you to follow several good praticals:\n\nthe name has to be simple and clearness. What’s better than a name that’s easy to understand and remember and ideally allows a reading to understand what it does.\navoid special caracters, like the accents or dot, and prefer use convention like Snake Case (each word is separated by and underscore character) or at least Camel Case (start with the first word with lowercase and capitalize the first letter of each word that follows withou space).\ninsure the compatibilty of the name with package respositories like the CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network) or Bioconductor.\n\nTo support you in this step, you can use functions of two R packages, pak [1] and available [2].\n\n\n\n\n1.
